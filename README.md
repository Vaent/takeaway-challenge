# Takeaway Challenge
A short project undertaken at Makers Academy as part of their accelerated apprenticeship program.

Users can set up a Takeaway object which has a Menu associated with it. The Menu takes an array of Dish objects at initialisation. Users can create an Order on the Takeaway and add Dishes to the Order. Each ordered Dish has an associated quantity.

Future functionality to implement includes:
- ensuring that a Dish can only be added to an Order if it exists in the Menu attached to the Takeaway
- checking the total cost of the Order is equal to the sum of the Dishes it contains
- submitting an Order once it has been populated
- confirming by SMS that the Order has been placed
